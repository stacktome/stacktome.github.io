* **Invite** - Campaign with primary purpose of generating reviews using invitations and reminders. See workflow help for details on each step. Possible to combine with response campaign when incentives are used.

* **Response** - Campaign used to send automatic response emails to customers that have left a review. Also can be used as a negative review recovery campaign by targetting customers that are likely to change their review to positive one or delete it, with optional incentives.
