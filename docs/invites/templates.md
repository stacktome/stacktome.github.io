# Email Templates

Here you can create an email template to be used in the invite/response campaigns.

* **SAVE** - If template is not published only saves the template, if template is published then updates published templates as well.
* **PUBLISH** - Publishes the template to ESP (Email service provider) so it can be used in the campaign. Publishing email template can take 10-30s and sometimes it can timeout. If you see error after publishing try to go back to previous page and open the template again to see if it is marked as published.
 * **SEND TEST EMAIL** - (Only when published) Sends a test email to a given email address. Note that all placeholder values will use a dummy order and review invite link will use a link to StackTome rather than your Trustpilot link. To do a full campaign test with actual customer order & generated review links, you will need to use "Test mode" in the campaign itself. Refer to [Campaign](/invites/campaign.md) for more info.

* **Name** - Template name. We recommend naming structure as follows - {campaign_type}-{campaign-shortname}-{version}-{language}, for example for Recent invite campaign 1st version for english, would be: invite-recent-v1-en. Once name is set it cannot be changed. However you can always copy the tempalte in the template list page.
- **Published** - Determines the status of your email template if it's published to the ESP or not yet.
- **Visual/Code** - Gives you an option to edit email template either using a visual editor or HTML (can be imported from other platforms like Klaviyo). Note once Code is set it cannot be changed back to Visual.

Here is a quick tutorial how you can set your email templates.
