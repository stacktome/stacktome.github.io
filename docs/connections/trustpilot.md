# Trustpilot Connection

This page describes connection workflows with Trustpilot.

## Using Custom API credentials

To connect with customer API credentials follow these steps:
1. Create an app for customer API credentials on Trustpilot on this page: https://businessapp.b2b.trustpilot.com/applications/
- set name as StackTome for example
- set redirect urls exactly as:
- - https://app.stacktome.com
- - https://services.stacktome.com/auth/v1/trustpilot
- Save the app
2. Open StackTome conections page and click connect on Trustpilot. 
3. Copy the API key and API secret in the fields
4. Click save and login to your Trustpilot account after page reload
5. Approve login on your email and wait for StackTome app to load
6. If you have multiple Trustpilot accounts, choose the one to connect to.
Note, ignore the empty fields for API key/secret as they are set automatically after Trustpilot redirect.
